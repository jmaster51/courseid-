<p> The purpose of this website is to inform you about the pros and cons of smartphones. Also, it is to teach you about the basics of a smartphone.
I would like this website to show you is that while smartphones might be cool and adicting, they can also distract us from one of the most importaint things. Life.
In this website I have included a youtube video on how to use a smartphone, I also have put someones story on how they were depressed because of smartphones, I will put pictures of diffrent types of smartphones as well.</p>
